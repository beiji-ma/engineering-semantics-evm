## **Abstract**
Engineering systems have historically relied on linear revision identifiers and workflow‑driven state machines to represent version change. While effective for document control and governance, these models cannot express the semantic, causal, variant‑driven, and cross‑domain nature of modern engineering evolution.

The **Engineering Versioning Model (EVM)** introduces the first unified semantic framework for engineering versioning across mechanical design, electronics, firmware, configuration rules, manufacturing processes, simulation parameters, and digital thread/digital twin ecosystems. EVM defines versioning as a multidimensional semantic construct—including intent, diff semantics, genealogy, lineage, effectivity context, and temporal/variant positioning—represented operationally as an **Engineering Version Graph (EVG)**.

The goal of this whitepaper is to establish EVM as a foundational semantic layer that integrates naturally with PLM/MBSE platforms and future AI‑native engineering systems.
