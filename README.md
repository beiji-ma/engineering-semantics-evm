## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains the official **Engineering Versioning Model (EVM)** whitepaper and supporting materials.  
EVM defines a **semantic versioning framework** designed specifically for engineering systems — spanning mechanical design, electronics, firmware, configuration rules, manufacturing processes, and digital thread/digital twin ecosystems.

Unlike traditional PLM revisioning (e.g., linear RevA → RevB → RevC), EVM models engineering evolution as a:

- **semantic object**  
- **causal node**  
- **multi-dimensional coordinate** (Time × Variant × Semantic)  
- **context-aware entity**  
- **graph structure (EVG)**  
- **AI-interpretable version representation**

This repository hosts the **full whitepaper**, diagrams, and glossary that define the EVM framework.

## 🎯 What Problems EVM Solves

Modern engineering systems suffer from deep structural limitations:

- Linear revisions cannot express **parallel variant evolution**  
- BOM, CAD, Firmware, Rules each evolve **independently**  
- Effectivity is treated as metadata, not **semantic applicability**  
- No system captures **engineering intent**  
- Causality is lost (no lineage)  
- AI cannot reason over unstructured engineering history  
- Digital thread and digital twin are often **version-incorrect**

EVM addresses these problems by introducing:

- Semantic diffs  
- Structural genealogy  
- Causal lineage  
- Variant/context axes  
- Intent-driven evolution  
- Multi-domain propagation semantics  
- Full graph representation via EVG  
- AI-ready engineering structures

## 🔍 What Is EVM?

EVM is a semantic framework defining:

- **Intent** — why the change exists  
- **Diff semantics** — what changed structurally/functionally  
- **Lineage** — how causality propagates across domains  
- **Genealogy** — structural derivation and decomposition  
- **Context** — where a version applies (variant, market, effectivity)  
- **Tensor coordinates** — version as Time × Variant × Semantic  
- **EVG** — Engineering Version Graph (runtime model)  

It is the missing semantic layer beneath PLM/MBSE systems.

## 🧠 Why EVM Matters

EVM enables:

- AI-native engineering reasoning  
- Full digital thread reconstruction  
- Context-correct and version-correct digital twins  
- Multi-variant, multi-domain version consistency  
- Causal evolution visibility  
- Automated impact analysis and propagation  
- Semantic versioning across CAD/ECAD/BOM/Firmware/Rules/Process  

EVM is not an extension of revision control —  
it is a **new theory of engineering version semantics**.

- OID (Object Identity)  
- Intent / Diff / Lineage / Genealogy  
- Effectivity and Variant Space  
- Semantic lifecycle verbs  
- CSI (Causal Snapshot Integration)  
- PQL (Property Query Language)
